//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "The process of determining user expectations for a new or modified product. These features, called requirements, must be quantifiable, relevant and detailed. In software engineering, such requirements are often called functional specifications."
const design = "Design can be divided into 3 levels of pahse of design, interface, architectual, and detailed. Design is the process by which an agent creates a specification of a software artifact intended to accomplish goals, using a set of primitive components and subject to constraints."
const implementation = "The software implementation stage involves the transformation of the software technical data package (TDP) into one or more fabricated, integrated, and tested software configuration items that are ready for software acceptance testing."
const testingAndIntegration = "Is a type of software testing in which the different units, modules or components of a software application are tested as a combined entity. However, these modules may be coded by different programmers."
const maintain = "The modification of a software product after delivery to correct faults, to improve performance or other attributes. A common perception of maintenance is that it merely involves fixing defects."
